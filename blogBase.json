And I think it's my first time typing in English to write long blog, and also my first time to post long blog on such a platform except social media.\nDespite of there are the programing communication platform, if with the enough spare time I also wamt to share some note of my learning of mathematics.\nIf you read over my note, thank you.It's pleased to see your comment if you want.Have a good day guys.\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1769572692, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173732132?v=4&size=64", "createdDate": "2026-01-28", "dateLabelColor": "#1f883d"}}, "singeListJson": {}, "labelColorDict": {"bug": "#d73a4a", "documentation": "#0075ca", "duplicate": "#cfd3d7", "enhancement": "#a2eeef", "good first issue": "#7057ff", "help wanted": "#008672", "invalid": "#e4e669", "question": "#d876e3", "wontfix": "#ffffff"}, "displayTitle": "Blog of Hasuki", "faviconUrl": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173732132?v=4&size=64", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173732132?v=4&size=64", "primerCSS": "<link href='https://mirrors.sustech.edu.cn/cdnjs/ajax/libs/Primer/21.0.7/primer.css' rel='stylesheet' />", "homeUrl": "https://JokerHasuki.github.io", "prevUrl": "disabled", "nextUrl": "disabled"}
